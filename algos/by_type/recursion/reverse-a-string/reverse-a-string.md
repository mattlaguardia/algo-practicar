# Recursion - Reverse a string

#### Prompt:

You are given a string `hello` and you need to reverse this string to be `olleh`. You are **NOT** able to use a for loop. This must be done recursively.

#### Example:

```
reverseString('hello') => 'olleh'
```

#### Constraints

Must use recursion - this will cause time to exponential - but thats fine for this exercise.

#### Hint

Think about how the call stack works.
